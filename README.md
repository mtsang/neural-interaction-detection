# Neural Interaction Detector (NID)
[M. Tsang](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~tsangm/), [D. Cheng](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~dehuache/), [Y. Liu](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/). Detecting Statistical Interactions from Neural Network Weights, ICLR 2018,
 [to appear](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByOfBggRZ).


## Usage


- Run demo at "neural\_interaction\_detector\_demo.ipynb"
	* the demo trains a simple multilayer perceptron on synthetic data containing interactions with nonlinearities. at the end of the notebook the interactions are found from decoding weights 
- requires python 3.0+, tested with tensorflow 1.2, scikit-learn 0.19, numpy 1.13.1
